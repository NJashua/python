## using numpy

# Library's are used in ml and data visu&analysis

1.)  For data science and data analysis

-> pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

2.) for ml and engineering teams
-> tensorflow, scikit-learn, xgboost or lightgbm, keras, pytorch, seaborn, opencv

3.) for web development
-> flask or Django and SQLALCHEMY for db operations


mean-> to find the average value in a data set
meadin -> to find the mid value in a dataset
mode-> to find the repeated value in a  dataset
std-> to find the standard deviation in a dataset by using scipy stats
percentile-> to find the percentiles are used in statistics to give you a number that describes the value that a
